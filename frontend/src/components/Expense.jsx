          The Expense Tracker MCP Server connects AI tools directly to a
          structured expense management system. This allows AI agents,
          assistants, and chatbots to add, update, delete, and summarize
          expenses through simple tool calls. It helps maintain consistent and
          accurate expense records without manual tracking. Users can interact
          with their spending data using natural language instead of complex
          forms or spreadsheets. All expense operations follow clear rules,
          ensuring reliable results. All through seamless AI-driven
          interactions.
